then we created a sign-in file.
and we inserted an user in put into the database,if the user don't have an account we are redirecting to an signup page,
then we ceated a user input sign-up form and stored a given user input in to mySQL.
every user should has an  unique id,and if the user has an same id as of other person there we informing the user to add another account.
then we uploaded a user sign up input to an data base server by using SQL form.
